# slack-todo

A simple TODO app for slack created using PHP to ease the task management process between team members who are using Slack.
TODO app uses slash commands to add/delete/retrieve TODO tasks.

Slash commands are 
    /addtodo ~ Add TODO task
    /listtodos ~ List all to do tasks
    /marktodo ~ Remove a TODO task

Every channel can manage it's own TODO tasks (i.e channel isolation).
